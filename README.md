Homebrew:
  	re-entry/orbit !entry / !orbit A B C D :: inspired by T5
```
Inspired by the SAFE/SLOW/FAST re-entry mechanic from Traveller 5, I have tweaked it for my own games. I uses the Speed Rating of the ship and the Planet UWP number to calculate ascent/descent speed, then uses Atmosphere UWP and Armour Rating to determine how much damage will be inflicted by friction and air resistance.
